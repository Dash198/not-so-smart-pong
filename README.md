# Not-So-Smart Pong!
An AI Agent that learns to play Pong... from you.

That's right, if you play this game long enough, you'll end up playing yourself!

The process is simple. The enemy AI is equipped with a **Decision Tree Classifier** (or a **Logistic Regressor**, you can change it :D) which will be trained on *your* decisions every time a rally ends!

If you wanna try it out, download/copy the code, make sure you have **Python**, **scikit-learn**, **NumPy** and **Pandas** installed, and run `pong.py` to begin training your apprentice paddle!
